# **Ad Blocker**

With its very on-the-nose name, Ad Blocker is a rather simple, but still functional, ad blocker for Google Chrome.

## __Installing__

Since Ad Blocker has not been published to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore), you need to download the ZIP file from the repo on GitHub or at https://ad-blocker.zacharyrude.repl.co/.

Once the ZIP archive has been downloaded, extract the `adblocker-master` folder. Since it is a Chrome extension, you need to have Google Chrome installed on your computer. If Chrome is not installed on your computer, download and install it from https://www.google.com/chrome/; otherwise, it will already be installed (e.g., if your're on a Chromebook or Android device), and you can simply launch it.

Assuming that Chrome is installed, go to `chrome://extensions/`, click on the "Load unpacked" button, select the extracted `adblocker-master`, and your're all set!
